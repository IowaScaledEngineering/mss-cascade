MSS-CASCADE-BASIC test

1) Program at *5V* from mss-cascade/src/mss-cascade-basic/program script

2) Set CA/CC switch to cathode

3) Plug in signal into each port and debugger into each port

4) Connect power, verify green light comes on

5) Flip CA/CC switch and all three LEDs should light for a second, and then go to green.

6) Set “advance approach in” on both debuggers if not already set (safe to just leave on)

7) Use tweezers to short switch A, verify signals go out after ~1s

8) Use tweezers to short switch B, verify signals go flashing yellow after ~1s

9) Set approach in on one debugger, verify advance approach out lights on the other and signal goes yellow

10) Set local block in on one debugger, verify approach out lights on the other and signal goes red

11) Clear all debugger inputs and repeat the last two steps in the opposite direction

12) Plug sensor tester into all three sensor ports.  Verify power LED lights.  
    Push button, verify relevant local block occupancy lights on the debugger and 
    signal goes red (IR sensor will trigger A & B, BD1 A & B will just trigger their respective side)
